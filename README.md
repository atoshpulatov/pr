## What is this repository?

This repository documents my one-year journey to learn more about machine learning.
My personal opinion is that learning is best facilitated by reading great books written by experts in a field.
This approach guarantees that the source material is of sufficient quality, and avoids the potential pitfall of overemphasizing technology and implementation over ideas.

## Where are the solutions?

This repository contains notes and solutions to selected exercises in the following books:

- [Pattern Classification](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Classification-Pt-1-Richard-Duda/dp/0471056693) by Duda et al.  ([Notes and solutions](docs/duda_solutions.pdf)), October 2018 to Desember 2018

## How should the material be used?

The material is published here since it might provide value for others.
In no way are the notes and solutions meant as a replacement for purchasing the literature.
If you decide to look at the solutions, please make an honest attempt at solving the problem on your own first.
If you have **improvements or additional solutions, please contribute** by submitting a Pull Request to this repository.
